## Configuring for Reproducible Builds


### What are Reproducible Builds?


 [Reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) are a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code. A build is **reproducible** if given the same source code, build environment and build instructions, any party can recreate **bit-by-bit** identical copies of all specified artifacts.


 [Reproducible Central](https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central) lists projects releases that have been checked as reproducible by rebuilding independently from the reference build published in Central Repository.



### How do I configure my Maven build?


 There is no Maven version prerequisite. Everything happens at plugin level:



 1 Upgrade your plugins to reproducible versions: to easily detect [required upgrades](/plugins/maven-artifact-plugin/plugin-issues.html), run

```
mvn artifact:check-buildplan
```


 1 Enable Reproducible Builds mode for plugins, by adding [`project.build.outputTimestamp` property](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId\=74682318#Reproducible/VerifiableBuilds-OutputArchiveEntriesTimestamp) to the project's `pom.xml`:

```
   <properties>
     <project.build.outputTimestamp>2023-01-01T00:00:00Z</project.build.outputTimestamp>
   </properties>
```



 You have the basics configured. The output should be mostly reproducible now.



### How to test my Maven build reproducibility?


 Using [`maven-artifact-plugin`'s `compare` goal](/plugins/maven-artifact-plugin/compare-mojo.html), you can check that the second build of your project produce the same output than an initial build:



 1 build and `install` your project (don't hesitate to customize arguments to better match your project):

```
mvn clean install 
```


 1 rebuild (`verify` only, without installing) and check against the previous install:

```
mvn clean verify artifact:compare
```




### How to fix my Maven build reproducibility?


 If something is still not reproducible after initial setup and [automatic check from `artifact:check-buildplan`](/plugins/maven-artifact-plugin/plugin-issues.html):



 1 Use [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) to find the unstable output between builds. The `artifact:buildinfo` goal proposes a command with path to files: just copy/paste to launch.

 1 Find the plugin that generated this output.

 1 Check if a reproducible version of the plugin is available. If not, please open an issue to help plugin maintainers improving Reproducible Builds support at every plugin level.



### More Details


 Reproducible Builds for Maven:



 - Require **no version ranges** in dependencies,

 - Generally give **different results on Windows and Unix** because of different newlines. (carriage return linefeed on Windows, linefeed on Unixes)

 - Generally depend on the **major version of the JDK** used to compile. (Even with source/target defined, each major JDK version changes the generated bytecode)


 For detailed explanations, see [Maven "Reproducible/Verifiable Builds" Wiki page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId\=74682318).



### FAQ



 - Q. Can the `project.build.outputTimestamp` property in `pom.xml` be updated automatically at release time?

   A. Yes.



   Details depend on your release process tooling:



  - if you use [maven-release-plugin](/plugins/maven-release-plugin/), you'll need **version 3.0.0-M1 or later**: it will automatically update the timestamp value in `pom.xml` during the release in the same commit that updates version,

  - if you have a custom release process tooling, you'll need to add the feature to your release tooling. Notice that if you're using `versions-maven-plugin` in custom release scripts, starting with release 2.9.0, [`versions:set` goal updates the property](https://github.com/mojohaus/versions-maven-plugin/issues/453).

  - instead of explicitely writing a timestamp in their `pom.xml`, some people tend to prefer using last Git commit timestamp, like `$\{git.commit.time\}` from [git-commit-id-maven-plugin](https://github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin).




 Don't hesitate to share your questions or solutions on [user mailing-list](/mailing-lists.html).



 - Q. Which additional plugins need to be updated for Reproducible Builds?

   A. Here is a simplified list:
