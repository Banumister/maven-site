The installation of Apache Maven is a simple process of extracting the archive 
and adding the `bin` directory with the `mvn` command to the `PATH`.

Detailed steps are:

* Have a JDK installation on your system. Either set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to your JDK installation or have the `java` executable on your `PATH`.

* Extract distribution archive in any directory 

```cmd
unzip apache-maven-${currentStableVersion}-bin.zip
```
or
```sh
tar xzvf apache-maven-${currentStableVersion}-bin.tar.gz
```

Alternatively use your preferred archive extraction tool.

* Add the `bin` directory of the created directory `apache-maven-${currentStableVersion}` to 
the `PATH` environment variable

* Confirm with `mvn -v` in a new shell. The result should look similar to

```
