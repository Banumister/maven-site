Introduction

 This document is intended to set up the Maven committer environment.

{Source File Encoding}

 When editing source files, make sure you use the right file encoding. For the Maven project, UTF-8 has been chosen
 as the default file encoding. UTF-8 is an encoding scheme for the Unicode character set and as such allows to encode
 all characters that Java can handle. The source files should not contain the byte order mark (BOM). There can be
 exceptions to this general rule, e.g. properties files are usually encoded using ISO-8859-1 as per the JRE API, so
 please keep this in mind, too.

Subversion Configuration

 Before committing files in subversion repository, you need to read the
 {{{https://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html#https-svn}Committer Subversion Access}}
 document and you must set your svn client with this properties file: {{{./svn-eol-style.txt}svn-eol-style.txt}}

{Maven Code Style}

 The following sections show how to set up the code style for Maven in IDEA and Eclipse.
 It is strongly preferred that patches use this style before they are supplied.

* IntelliJ IDEA

 Download <<<{{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=maven-shared-resources.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/main/resources/config/maven-idea-codestyle.xml;hb=HEAD}eclipse-formatter-config.xml}}>>>
 and import it into IDEA using Intellij IDEA > Preferences > Editor > Code Style > Java > Gear icon >
 Import Scheme (> Intellij IDEA code style XML)

* Eclipse

 Download <<<{{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=maven-shared-resources.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/main/resources/config/maven-eclipse-codestyle.xml;hb=HEAD}eclipse-formatter-config.xml}}>>>.

 After this, select Window \> Preferences, and open up the configuration for Java \> Code
 Style \> Code Formatter. Click on the button labeled Import... and select the file you
 downloaded. Give the style a name, and click OK.

 To ensure a package import order consistent with the layout described below, download
 <<<{{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=maven-shared-resources.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/main/resources/config/maven-eclipse-importorder.txt;hb=HEAD}maven-eclipse-importorder.txt}}>>>, select Window \> Preferences and
 navigate to Java \> Code Style \> Organize Imports. Click on Import... and select the downloaded
 file to change the import order.

Useful software

 The Maven Team uses several software. Here is a partial list:

 * {{{http://www.cygwin.com/}Cygwin}}: collection of free software tools to allow various versions of Microsoft
   Windows to act somewhat like a Unix system

 * {{{http://www.gnupg.org/}GnuPG}}: GNU Privacy Guard.
