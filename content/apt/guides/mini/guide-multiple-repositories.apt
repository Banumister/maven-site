Setting up Multiple Repositories

 There are two different ways that you can specify the use of multiple repositories. The first
 way is to specify in a POM which repositories you want to use. That is supported both inside and outside of build profiles:

+----+

<project>
...
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>my-repo1</id>
      <name>your custom repo</name>
      <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
    </repository>
    <repository>
      <id>my-repo2</id>
      <name>your custom repo</name>
      <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
...
</project>

+----+

 <<NOTE:>> You will also get the standard set of repositories as defined in the 
 {{{../introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html#Super_POM}Super POM}}.



 The other way you can specify multiple repositories is by creating a profile in the
 <<<$\{user.home\}/.m2/settings.xml>>> or <<<$\{maven.home\}/conf/settings.xml>>> file like the following:

+----+

<settings>
 ...
 <profiles>
   ...
   <profile>
     <id>myprofile</id>
     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>my-repo2</id>
         <name>your custom repo</name>
         <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
       </repository>
     </repositories>
   </profile>
   ...
 </profiles>

 <activeProfiles>
   <activeProfile>myprofile</activeProfile>
 </activeProfiles>
 ...
</settings>

+----+

 If you specify repositories in profiles you must remember to activate that
 particular profile! As you can see above we do this by registering a profile
 to be active in the <<<activeProfiles>>> element.

 You could also activate this profile on the command like by executing the following
 command:

+----+

mvn -Pmyprofile ...

+----+

 In fact the <<<-P>>> option will take a CSV list of profiles to activate if you wish to
 activate multiple profiles simultaneously.
 
 <<Note>>: The settings descriptor documentation can be found on the {{{../../maven-settings/settings.html}Maven Local Settings Model Website}}.
 
* Repository Order

  Repository URLs are queried in the following order for artifacts until one returns a valid result:

  [[1]] Global <<<settings.xml>>>

  [[1]] User <<<settings.xml>>>

  [[1]] Local POM

  [[1]] Parent POMs, recursively

  [[1]] Super POM

  []

  For each of these locations, the repositories within the profiles are queried first in the order outlined at {{{../introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html}Introduction to build profiles}}.
