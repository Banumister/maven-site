* {Introduction}

 Maven 2.1.0+ now supports server password encryption. The main use case, addressed by this solution is:

   * multiple users share the same build machine (server, CI box)
   
   * some users have the privilege to deploy Maven artifacts to repositories, some don't.
   
      ** this applies to any server operations, requiring authorization, not only deployment
   
   * <<<settings.xml>>> is shared between users

 The implemented solution adds the following capabilities:

   * authorized users have an additional <<<settings-security.xml>>> file in their <<<~/.m2>>> folder
   
      ** this file either contains encrypted <<master password>>, used to encrypt other passwords
      
      ** or it can contain a <<relocation>> - reference to another file, possibly on removable storage
      
      ** this password is created first via CLI for now
      
   * server entries in the <<<settings.xml>>> have passwords and/or keystore passphrases encrypted
    
      ** for now - this is done via CLI <<after>> master password has been created and stored in appropriate location

* {How to create a master password}

 Use the following command line:
 
+------------------------------------+
mvn --encrypt-master-password <password>
+------------------------------------+

 This command will prompt you for the master password and will produce an encrypted version of it, something like
 
+------------------------------------+
{jSMOWnoPFgsHVpMvz5VrIt5kRbzGpI8u+9EF1iFQyJQ=}
+------------------------------------+

 Please store this password in the <<<~/.m2/settings-security.xml>>>; it should look like 
 
+------------------------------------+
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{jSMOWnoPFgsHVpMvz5VrIt5kRbzGpI8u+9EF1iFQyJQ=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
+------------------------------------+

 When this is done, you can start encrypting existing server passwords.

* {How to encrypt server passwords}

 You will have to use the same command line tool as used for the master password (see above), but the parameter is different: <<-p>>

 Use the following command line:
 
+------------------------------------+
mvn --encrypt-password <password>
+------------------------------------+

 This command will prompt you for a password and will produce an encrypted version of it, something like
 
+------------------------------------+
{COQLCE6DU6GtcS5P=}
+------------------------------------+

 Cut-n-paste it into your <<<settings.xml>>> file in the server section. This will look like:
 
+------------------------------------+
<settings>
...
  <servers>
...
    <server>
      <id>my.server</id>
      <username>foo</username>
      <password>{COQLCE6DU6GtcS5P=}</password>
    </server>
...
  </servers>
...
</settings>
+------------------------------------+

 Then you can use, say, deploy plugin, to write to this server:
 
+------------------------------------+
mvn deploy:deploy-file -Durl=https://maven.corp.com/repo \
                       -DrepositoryId=my.server \
                       -Dfile=your-artifact-1.0.jar \
+------------------------------------+



* {How to keep the master password on removable drive}

 Create the master password exactly as described above, and store it on a 
 removable drive, for instance on OSX, my USB drive mounts as <<</Volumes/mySecureUsb>>>, 
 so I store 
 
+------------------------------------+
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{jSMOWnoPFgsHVpMvz5VrIt5kRbzGpI8u+9EF1iFQyJQ=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
+------------------------------------+

 in the file <<</Volumes/mySecureUsb/secure/settings-security.xml>>>

 And then I create <<<~/.m2/settings-security.xml>>> with the following content:
 
+------------------------------------+
<settingsSecurity>
  <relocation>/Volumes/mySecureUsb/secure/settings-security.xml</relocation>
</settingsSecurity>
+------------------------------------+

 This assures that encryption will only work when the usb drive is mounted by OS. 
 This addresses a use case where only certain people are authorized to deploy and 
 are issued these devices.
