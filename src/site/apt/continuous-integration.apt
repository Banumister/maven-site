Continuous Integration

 Currently our script-based CI is running from maven.zones.apache.org under
 the _maven_ user. Currently this is just our {{{http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/components/trunk/ci.sh?view=markup}ci.sh}
 script.

 We currently do not have Continuum running anywhere for Maven projects but
 we're working on it.
